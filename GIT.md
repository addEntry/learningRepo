    ```

#### - working with branches -

    * master branch --> stable one
    * new feature branch --> 'we' keep working along the master one
    * merge is the moment when the new feature developed along the master
      branche is ready to be include in (good practice!)

  * viewing branches
    ```bash
    git branch
    ```

  * create a new branch
    ```bash
    git branch <newBranch>
    ```

  * switch between branches
    ```bash
    git checkout <myNewbranch>
    ```

  * deleting branches
    ```bash
    git branch -d <myBranch>
    ```

  * mergin branches (take my branch and take it to the master)
    ```bash
    git merge <myBranch>
    ```
